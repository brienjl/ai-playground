# ai playground ü§ñüß†
 
Messing around with ai and chat-GiPiDi(Tee). Feel free to steal my code before co-pilot does. It's not production grade, but I am focusing on design patterns and spiking on interesting topics. Code is commented -- mostly for me. 

## roadmap
Here's my roadmap. If I deep dive into anything, I'll cross-link those projects in the table of contents below.
